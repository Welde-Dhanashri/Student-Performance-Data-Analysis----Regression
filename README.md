# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of student performance using various attributes to identify key factors affecting their academic outcomes.

# ðŸ“Œ Objective
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the student performance dataset.
* Identify patterns, trends, and key factors affecting student outcomes.
* Detect and handle missing values and outliers.
* Visualize relationships between variables for insights.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
* Source: xAPI-Edu-Data.csv
* gender: Gender of the student (e.g., Male, Female)
* NationalITy: Nationality of the student
* PlaceofBirth: Where the student was born
* StageID: The stage or level of education the student is in
* GradeID: The grade the student is in
* SectionID: The section the student belongs to
* Topic: The subject the student is studying
* Semester: The semester during which data was recorded
* Relation: Parentâ€™s relationship status
* raisedhands: Number of times the student raised their hand in class
* VisITedResources: Number of resources the student accessed for learning
* AnnouncementsView: Number of announcements the student viewed
* Discussion: Number of discussions the student took part in
* ParentAnsweringSurvey: Whether the studentâ€™s parent answered a survey (Yes/No)
